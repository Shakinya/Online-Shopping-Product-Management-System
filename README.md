# 🛒 Shopping System – Java OOP Project

This is a **Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project designed to simulate a basic shopping system. It demonstrates fundamental OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. The project includes both implementation and documentation, developed as part of an academic assignment.
